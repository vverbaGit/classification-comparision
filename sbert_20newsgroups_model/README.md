    See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information.


    I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.


    It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should

    avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before

    preparing or eating meals.  The latter is sound advice at any time of

    course.


    Apart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to

    Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis



    Dear Josh


    I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.


    Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.


    1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards

    identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.

    citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are

    just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic

    country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or

    religious identity to any public official who so requests ?


    2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all

    kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.

    You did not respond to my question.


    3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is

    interesting. You say that Israeli ''probably'' stocks nuclear

    weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?


    4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a

    Ma''ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases

    like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about

    those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and

    imprisoned.


    5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status

    of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I

    understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for

    the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).

    The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,

    why doesn''t it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?


    6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return

    conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands

    of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under

    Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from

    returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also

    left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to

    return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?

    Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge

    somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in

    his homeland ?


    7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an

    order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that

    information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all

    inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These

    expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other

    atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by

    Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the

    Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University

    Press. Is this book available in your library ?


    8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in

    Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very

    little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many

    Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are

    not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want

    Arabs ?


    9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was

    whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to

    discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but

    evaded it by saying that the ''entire religious establishment wants

    to keep it what way''. I am certain that if only religious

    communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish

    civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests

    to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a

    secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.



    I would be glad to have some more input from you after these

    comments.'

    As an earlier post noted - through DMA.




    Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of

    DMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If

    the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA

    bandwidth, this will work.


    Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA

    controller.

    I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many

    verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been

    shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)

    Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion

    of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well

    as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses

    and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We

    must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the

    interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with

    them.'

    "Let me remind all of those Muslim-haters out there who like to\nmention the Mufti's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslims\nbe slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts:\n\n1)Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY, THE CROATS,\nAND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER?\n\n2)Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemy\nat the time (Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible\nfor most atrocities against Muslims in the region) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF\nEVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM?\n\n3)As far as Muslims are concerned : THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nNAZI GERMANY, AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAIN/FRANCE IN 1940. They were\nall racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. WWII and the wars \nin ALgeria, Sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. Even anti-\nsemitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain, it just\nhappened to be official policy in Germany.\n\nAnd we will forgive you, just set our countries free.",
    "From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nDear Josh\n\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\n\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\n\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\n\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\nYou did not respond to my question.\n\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\n\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\nimprisoned.\n\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\n\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\nhis homeland ?\n\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\n\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\nArabs ?\n\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\n\n\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\ncomments.",
